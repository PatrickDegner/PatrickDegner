# Welcome to my Github!

Since you've made the effort to stop by, I'd like to tell you a little about myself.

As a passionate cloud / data engineer, I specialize in the development and implementation of scalable cloud solutions.
My focus is on implementing cloud-native architectures, optimizing data pipelines and ensuring data quality.

My passion for innovation drives me to always stay at the cutting edge of technological developments and develop new solutions.

I like to work in the cloud.
Unlimited compute and storage capacities. Nice!

Kinda sounds like a car-fanboy in data. Maybe im data driven? oO

</br>

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Engineering, Cloud Platforms, Star Wars and Assassins Creed
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning another Tool or Technology
- âš¡ My hobbies are Music, gaming, cooking and eating ;)
