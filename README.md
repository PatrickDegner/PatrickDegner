# Welcome to my Github!

Since you came here, let me introduce me.

I'm Patrick, Data Engineer from Germany.

I love to work with any kind of data.
- ETL or ELT Pipelines?
- Extract from different sources?
- Transform data for analyses?
- Fill a Datawarehouse or build a new one?

Count me in! :)

</br>

I like to work in the cloud.
Unlimited compute and storage capacities. Nice!

Kinda sounds like a car-fanboy in data. Maybe im data driven? oO

</br>

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Programming and Data Engineering
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning another ELT tool
- âš¡ My hobbies are Music, MMORPG's, cooking and eating ;)
