Welcome to my profile!

Since you came here, let me introduce me.

I love to work with any kind of data
- ETL or ELT Pipelines?
- Extract from different sources?
- Transform data for analyses?
- Fill a Datawarehouse or build a new one?
Count me in! :)

I like to work in the cloud.
Unlimited compute and storage capacities. Nice!

Kinda sounds like a PS Fanboy in data oO


ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Programming and Data Engineering
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning another ELT tool.
âš¡ My hobbies are Music, MMORPG's, cooking and eating ;)
